In first case we have no \n , so it means that `Hello` 
string will be in buffer BEFORE fork(). 

Since fork() create a full snapshot of the process, 
content of buffer will be also copyied to new fork (why does he do it ...?)
and printed twice

In the second case buffer is flashed AFTER fork() and everything works OK.
