Physical address (PA) is exactly the memory of the computer (RAM). 

However, it's hard to work with PA without any abstraction, because you need to work 
with blocks without adjacent addresses. That's why we need Virtual address (VA)

VA is convenient abstraction that allows us to work with memory as 
if it is sequential and continuous. Also VA helps when we need more memory than RAM has
